A quick document to help recreate the database and add a new user. If database is already created you can add a new user by following step2 onwards

Step 1 - Recreate Database
./stop_whole_stack.sh
sudo rm -rf ./postgres
mkdir ./postgres
cd ./docker/nplbam_postgres
./build.sh
cd ../..
./start_whole_stack.sh

Step 2 - Go to the website and try logging in with any username/password. This will start the creation process of the database.

Step 3 - Get Argo Encryption of Password (Change PASSWORD to your password)
source nplbamNV/bin/activate
python
import nacl.pwhash
print(nacl.pwhash.str(b'PASSWORD'))
exit()


Step 4 - Add user to database .. making sure to put the password from before in >>pass from before<<. Also make sure to put a proper username at USER
./connect_psql.sh
\c nplbam
\dt
INSERT INTO "Users" (username, password, "userLVL") VALUES ('USER', >>pass from before<< , 0); 
exit
